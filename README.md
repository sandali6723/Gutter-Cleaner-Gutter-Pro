Automated Gutter Cleaner

Rain gutter cleaning is a risky and labor-intensive task, especially for elderly homeowners. To address this, I developed a prototype of an automated gutter cleaner integrating embedded control and actuation systems.

System Architecture:
 Controller: Arduino Nano for compact and efficient control
 Actuator: Servo motor for precise opening/closing of the cleaning mechanism
 Control Inputs: Dual switch interface (ON/OFF and Open/Close) for user-friendly operation

Design Objective:
 Enhance safety by eliminating roof climbing
 Provide a low-cost, reliable alternative to manual labor
 Demonstrate practical application of microcontroller-based control in household automation

This project showcases how mechatronic design and embedded systems can solve real-world problems with affordable and accessible technology.
